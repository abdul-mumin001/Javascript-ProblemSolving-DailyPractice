<!-- HTML Interview Questions and Answers
1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
No. HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, may contain some content and a closing tag.For example, <h1>Heading 1</h1> is a 
HTML element but just <h1> is a starting tag and </h1> is a closing tag.

2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?
Tags are the primary component of the HTML that defines how the content will be structured/ formatted, whereas Attributes are used along
 with the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the element. For example, <p align=” center”>Interview questions</p>, in this the
  'align' is the attribute using which we will align the paragraph to show in the center of the view.

3. What are void elements in HTML?
HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. For Example <br />, <img />, <hr />, etc.

4. What is the advantage of collapsing white space?
In HTML, a blank sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a single space character, Because the browser collapses multiple spaces
 into a single space character and this helps a developer to indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces and maintain 
 readability and understandability of HTML codes.

5. What are HTML Entities?
In HTML some characters are reserved like '<',' >', '/', etc. To use these characters in our webpage we need to use the character 
entities called HTML Entities. Below are a few mapping between the reserved character and its respective entity character to be used.

Character	                    Entity Name 	                        Entity Number
 <	                                 &lt;	                            &#60;
 >	                                 &gt;	                            &#62;
 &	                                 &amp;	                            &#38;
(non-breaking space) Eg. 10  PM	    &nbsp; Eg. <p>10&nbsp&nbspPM</p>	&#160;


7. What is the 'class' attribute in HTML?
The class attribute is used to specify the class name for an HTML element. Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value. 
Also, it is mainly used to associate the styles written in the stylesheet with the HTML elements.

8. What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML elements?
Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value, whereas a value of id attribute of one element cannot be associated with
 another HTML element.

9. Define multipart form data?
Multipart form data is one of the values of the enctype attribute. It is used to send the file data to the server-side for processing.
 The other valid values of the enctype attribute are text/plain and application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

10. Describe HTML layout structure.
Every web page has different components to display the intended content and a specific UI. But still, there are few things which are 
templated and are globally accepted way to structure the web page, such as:

<header>: Stores the starting information about the web page.
<footer>: Represents the last section of the page.
<nav>: The navigation menu of the HTML page.
<article>: It is a set of information.
<section>: It is used inside the article block to define the basic structure of a page.
<aside>: Sidebar content of the page.
11. How to optimize website assets loading?
To optimize website load time we need to optimize its asset loading and for that:

CDN hosting - A CDN or content delivery network is geographically distributed servers to help reduce latency.
File compression - This is a method that helps to reduce the size of an asset to reduce the data transfer
File concatenation - This reduces the number of HTTP calls
Minify scripts - This reduces the overall file size of js and CSS files
Parallel downloads - Hosting assets in multiple subdomains can help to bypass the download limit of 6 assets per domain of all modern
 browsers. This can be configured but most general users never modify these settings.
Lazy Loading - Instead of loading all the assets at once, the non-critical assets can be loaded on a need basis.
12. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?
 HTML has various formatting tags:

<b> - makes text bold
<i> - makes text italic
<em> - makes text italic but with added semantics importance
<big> - increases the font size of the text by one unit
<small> - decreases the font size of the text by one unit
<sub> - makes the text a subscript
<sup> - makes the text a superscript
<del> - displays as strike out text
<strong> - marks the text as important
<mark> - highlights the text
<ins> - displays as added text
13. What are the different kinds of Doctypes available?
The three kinds of Doctypes which are available:

Strict Doctype 
Transitional Doctype
Frameset Doctype
14. Please explain how to indicate the character set being used by a document in HTML?
The character set is defined in <meta> tag inside <head> element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   ...
   ...
 </head>
 ...
</html>
15. What is the difference between <strong>, <b> tags and <em>, <i> tags?
The effect on a normal webpage of the tags <strong>, <b>  and <em>, <i> is the same. <b> and <i> tags stands for bold and italic. These
     two tags only apply font styling and bold tag <b>, just adds more ink to the text, these tags don't say anything about the text.

Whereas, <strong> and <em> tags represent that the span of text is of strong importance or more importance and emphatic stress 
    respectively than the rest of the text. These tags have semantic meaning.

16. What is the significance of <head> and <body> tag in HTML?
<head> tag provides the information about the document. It should always be enclosed in the <html> tag. This tag contains the metadata 
    about the webpage and the tags which are enclosed by head tag like <link>, <meta>, <style>, <script>, etc. are not displayed on the 
    web page. Also, there can be only 1 <head> tag in the entire Html document and will always be before the <body> tag.

<body> tag defines the body of the HTML document. It should always be enclosed in the <html> tag. All the contents which needs to be
     displayed on the web page like images, text, audio, video, contents, using elements like <p>, <img>, <audio>, <heading>, <video>,
         <div>, etc. will always be enclosed by the <body> tag. Also, there can be only 1 body element in an HTML document and will 
            always be after the <head> tag.

17. Can we display a web page inside a web page or Is nesting of webpages possible?
Yes, we can display a web page inside another HTML web page. HTML provides a tag <iframe> using which we can achieve this functionality.

<iframe src=”url of the web page to embed” />

18. How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?
Cell Spacing is the space or gap between two consecutive cells. Whereas, Cell Padding is the space or gap between the text/ content of
 the cell and the edge/ border of the cell. Please refer to the above figure example to find the difference.

19. How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?
HTML provides two table attributes “rowspan” and “colspan” to make a cell span to multiple rows and columns respectively.

20. Is it possible to change an inline element into a block level element?
Yes, it is possible using the “display” property with its value as “block”, to change the inline element into a block-level element.

21. In how many ways can we position an HTML element? Or what are the permissible values of the position attribute?
There are mainly 7 values of position attribute that can be used to position an HTML element:

static: Default value. Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
absolute: Here the element is positioned relative to its parent element. The final position is determined by the values of left, right, 
top, bottom.
fixed: This is similar to absolute except here the elements are positioned relative to the <html> element.
relative: Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document and positioned relative to its original/ normal
 position.
initial: This resets the property to its default value.
inherit: Here the element inherits or takes the property of its parent.

22. In how many ways you can display HTML elements?
inline: Using this we can display any block-level element as an inline element. The height and width attribute values of the element
 will not affect.
block: using this, we can display any inline element as a block-level element. 
inline-block: This property is similar to inline, except by using the display as inline-block, we can actually format the element using 
height and width values.
flex: It displays the container and element as a flexible structure. It follows flexbox property.
inline-flex: It displays the flex container as an inline element while its content follows the flexbox properties.
grid: It displays the HTML elements as a grid container.
none: Using this property we can hide the HTML element.
Below are some of the display types which are rarely used:

table
inline-table
table-cell
table-column
table-row
inline-grid
list-item
inherit
initial
table-caption

23. What is the difference between “display: none” and “visibility: hidden”, when used as attributes to the HTML element.
When we use the attribute “visibility: hidden” for an HTML element then that element will be hidden from the webpage but still takes up
 space. Whereas, if we use the “display: none” attribute for an HTML element then the element will be hidden, and also it won't take up
  any space on the webpage.

24. How to specify the link in HTML and explain the target attribute?
HTML provides a hyperlink - <a> tag to specify the links in a webpage. The 'href' attribute is used to specify the link and the 'target'
attribute is used to specify, where do we want to open the linked document. The 'target' attribute can have the following values:

_self: This is a default value. It opens the document in the same window or tab as it was clicked.
_blank: It opens the document in a new window or tab.
_parent: It opens the document in a parent frame.
_top: It opens the document in a full-body window.

25. In how many ways can we specify the CSS styles for the HTML element?
There are three ways in which we can specify the styles for HTML elements:

Inline: Here we use the 'style' attribute inside the HTML element.
Internal: Here we use the <style> tag inside the <head> tag. To apply the style we bind the elements using 'id' or 'class' attributes.
External: Here we use the <link> tag inside <head> tag to reference the CSS file into our HTML code. Again the binding between elements
     and styles is done using 'id' or 'class' attributes. -->



 <!-- 26. Difference between link tag <link> and anchor tag <a>?
        The anchor tag <a> is used to create a hyperlink to another webpage or to a certain part of the webpage and these links are
             clickable, whereas, link tag <link> defines a link between a document and an external resource and these are not clickable.

        
 27. How to include javascript code in HTML?
        HTML provides a <script> tag using which we can run the javascript code and make our HTML page more dynamic.
        
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
           <body>
            <h1>
                  <span>This is a demo for </span>
                  <u><span id="demo"></span></u>
           </h1>
           <script>
               document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "script Tag"
           </script>
           </body>
        </html>
28. When to use scripts in the head and when to use scripts in the body?
        If the scripts contain some event-triggered functions or jquery library then we should use them in the head section. If the 
        script writes the content on the page or is not inside a function then it should be placed inside the body section at the 
        bottom. In short, follow below three points:
        
        Place library scripts or event scripts in the head section.
        Place normal scripts that do not write anything on the page, in the head section until there is any performance issue.
        Place scripts that render something on the web page at the bottom of the body section.
        29. What are forms and how to create forms in HTML?
        The HTML form is used to collect the user inputs. HTML provides a <form> tag to create forms. To take input from the user 
            we use the <input> tag inside the form so that all collected user data can be sent to the server for processing. There 
            are different input types like 'button', 'checkbox', 'number', 'text', 'password', 'submit' etc.
        
        <form action="/submit_data.php">
           <label>Enter your name: </label>
           <input type="text" name="name" /> 
           <label>Enter Mobile number </label>
           <input type="number" name="mobile_no"/>
           <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
30. How to handle events in HTML?
    HTML allows event trigger actions in browsers using javascript or JQuery. There are a lot of events like 'onclick', 'ondrag', 
    'onchange', etc.
        
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
           <body style="padding-top:50px">
               <h3 id="event_demo">0</h3>
               <input type="button" onclick="myFunction()" value="Click Me" />
               <input type="reset" onclick="reset()" value="Reset" />
           </body>
           
        <script>
               function myFunction() {
                   var value = document.getElementById("event_demo").innerHTML
                   value = parseInt(value) + 1;
                   document.getElementById("event_demo").innerHTML = value;
               }
               function reset() {
                   document.getElementById("event_demo").innerHTML = 0;
               }
           </script>
        </html>      -->






 <!-- 1. What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the language of the internet. This standard text formatting language is used to 
create and display pages on the Internet. HTML documents include elements and tags that format it for proper display on pages.

2. What are HTML tags?
HTML tags are used for placing elements in the proper and appropriate format. The tags, < and >, set them apart from the HTML content.
 It is not always necessary to close these HTML tags. For example, in the case of images, the closing tags are not required as  tag.

3. What are HTML attributes?
Attributes are properties that are added to an HTML tag. They change the way the tag behaves or is displayed. Attributes are added 
right after the name of the HTML tag, inside the brackets. Attributes can be added to opening or self-closing tags, but never in closing tags.

For example, the  tag has an src attribute, which can add the source from which the image should be displayed.

4. What is a marquee in HTML?
Marquee in HTML is used to scroll text or image on a web page. It can scroll up, down, left, or right automatically. Marquee can be 
applied by using tags.

5. How do you separate a section of texts in HTML?
A section of texts in HTML can be separated with the help of the following tags:

<br> - It is used to separate the line of text by breaking the current line and moving the flow of the text to a new line.
<p> - It is used to write a paragraph of text.
<blockquote> - It is used to define large quoted sections.
6. Define the list types in HTML?
Following are the list types in HTML:

Ordered list - The ordered list displays elements in a numbered format with the help of the <ol> tag.
Unordered list - The unordered list displays elements in a bulleted format with the help of the <ul> tag.
Definition list - The definition list uses <dl>, <dt>, and <dd> tags for displaying elements in definition form.
7. What are void elements in HTML?
HTML elements that do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are known as void elements. For example
,

, , etc.

8. What is the advantage of collapsing white space?
In HTML, a blank sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a single space character. The browser collapses the multiple spaces 
into a single space character thus aiding a developer to indent lines of text without the need to worry about multiple spaces. In this
 way, readability and understandability of HTML codes is maintained.

9. What are HTML entities?
In HTML some characters like '<', '>', '/', etc. are reserved. To use them in web pages, character entities or HTML entities need to 
be used. Below are a few mapping between the reserved character and its respective entity character to be used.

Character	Entity Name	Entity Number
<	             &lt;	&#60;
>	             &gt;	&#62;
&	             &amp;	&#38;
(non-breaking space) Eg. 10 PM	&nbsp; Eg. <p>10&nbsp&nbspPM</p>	&#160;
10. What is the 'class' attribute in HTML?
The 'class' attribute specifies the class name for an HTML element. Multiple HTML elements can have the same class value. It is
 primarily used to associate the styles on the stylesheet with the HTML elements.

To acquire the skills necessary to become a Web Developer, you must enroll in one of the best Web Development Courses from Intellipaat.

11. What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML elements?
Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value. The same is not true for an id attribute of an element.

12. Describe the HTML layout structure.
For the purpose of displaying the intended content and specific UI, each web page has to include different components. However, few
 things in the HTML layout structure come templated and are universally accepted practices. For example:

<header>: It is used to include the starting information about the web page
<footer>: A footer represents the final section of a web page
<nav>: It involves the navigation menu of the HTML page
<article>: It is a set of information
<section>: This defines the basic structure of a page and is used inside the article block
<aside>: It is used for the sidebar content of a web page
13. Compare HTML & XML
Criteria	HTML	XML
Deployed for	Rendering things on screen	Describing what things are
Functioning area	Human to computer interaction	Computer to computer interaction
Can explain what data means	No	Yes
14. What is $() in jQuery library?
The $() function is an alias of the jQuery() function, at first it looks weird and makes jQuery code cryptic, but once you get used 
to it, you will love its brevity. $() function is used to wrap any object into a jQuery object, which then allows you to call various
 method-defined jQuery objects. You can even pass a selector string to the $()function, and it will return a jQuery object containing 
 an array of all matched DOM elements. I have seen this jQuery asked several times, despite it being quite basic. It is used to
  differentiate between developers who knows jQuery and those who do not.

-->

<!-- 15. What are the advantages of using jQuery?
Easy to use and learn
Easily expandable
Cross-browser support (IE 6.0+, FF 1.5+, Safari 2.0+, Opera 9.0+)
Easy to use for DOM manipulation and traversal
Large pool of built-in methods
AJAX capabilities
Methods for changing or applying CSS, creating animations
Event detection and handling
Tons of plug-ins for all kinds of needs
16. Explain the difference between ID selector and class selector in jQuery.
If you have used CSS, then you might know the difference between ID and class selector. It’s the same with jQuery. ID selector uses ID 
e.g. #element1 to select element, while class selector uses CSS class to select elements. When you just need to select only one element,
 use ID selector, while if you want to select a group of elements, having the same CSS class then use a class selector. There is a good 
 chance that the interviewer will ask you to write a code using ID and class selector. From a syntax perspective, as you can see,
  another difference between ID and class selector is that the former uses “#” and later uses the “.” character.

17. What is the difference between $(this) and this keyword in jQuery?
This could be a tricky question for many jQuery beginners, but it’s in fact the simplest one. $(this) returns a jQuery object, on which
 you can call several jQuery methods e.g. text() to retrieve text, val() to retrieve value, etc. While this represents the current element, it’s one of the JavaScript keywords to denote the current DOM element in a context. You can not call the jQuery method on this until it’s wrapped using the $() function i.e. $(this).

18. What is the main advantage of loading the jQuery library using CDN?
This is a slightly advanced jQuery question, and don’t expect that jQuery beginners can answer that. Well, apart from many advantages 
including reducing server bandwidth and faster download, one of the most important advantages is that if the browser has already downloaded  the same jQuery version from the same CDN, then it won’t download it again. Nowadays, almost any public website uses jQuery for user interaction and animation, so there is a very good chance that browsers already have the jQuery library downloaded.


19. What is “Semantic HTML?”
Semantic HTML is a coding style where the tags embody what the text is meant to convey. Also known as semantic markup, this HTML
 introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph.

Tags for bold and italic are not examples of semantic HTML as they just represent formatting and provide no indication of meaning or 
structure.

20. What is a class? What is an ID?
A class is a style (i.e., a group of CSS attributes) that can be applied to one or more HTML elements. This means it can apply to 
instances of the same element or instances of different elements to which the same style can be attached. Classes are defined in CSS
 using a period followed by the class name. It is applied to an HTML element via the class attribute and the class name.

The following snippet shows a class defined and its application to an HTML DIV element.

.test {
font-family: Helvetica;
font-size: 20;
background: black;
}
test
Also, you could define a style for all elements with a defined class. This is demonstrated with the following code that selects all P 
elements with specified column class.

p.column {
font-color: black;
}
An ID selector is a name assigned to a specific style. It can be associated with one HTML element with the assigned ID. Within CSS, ID 
selectors are defined with the # character followed by the selector name.

The following snippet shows the CSS example1 defined followed by the use of an HTML element’s ID attribute, which pairs it with the CSS 
selector.

#example1 {
background: blue;
}
21. What is Grouping?
When more than one selector shares the same declaration, they may be grouped together via a comma-separated list; this allows you to 
reduce the size of the CSS (every bit and byte is important) and makes it more readable. The following snippet applies the same 
background to the first three heading elements.h1, h2, h3 {background: red;}

22. Why do we use alternative texts in images?
Image mapping can get confusing if it is hard to understand which hotspots correspond to a particular link. Alternative texts include a 
description at each link making it easier to understand the hotspot links.

23. How to create a new HTML element?
New HTML elements can be created in the following way:

<script>
document.createElement﴾"myElement"﴿
</script>
or

<myElement>hello Intellipaat!</myElement>
24. What are the uses of a span tag? Explain with an example.
The span tag is used for styling purposes like:

Adding color to text
Highlighting any color text
Adding background on text
Example:

<span style="color:#ffffff;">
In this page we use span.

</span>
25. Explain the key differences between localStorage and sessionStorage objects.
The key differences between localStorage and sessionStorage objects are:

The localStorage object stores data indefinitely, while sessionStorage object stores them for only one session.
In the case of a localStorage object, when the browser window is closed, the data will not be erased. However, in the case of 
sessionStorage objects, the data will get erased after the browser window is closed.
The data that is stored in the sessionStorage is accessible only in the current browser window. The data that is stored in the 
localStorage can be accessed by multiple browser windows.
26. What is the hierarchy when it comes to style sheets?
If there are three different style definitions in a single selector, precedence is given to the definition that is closest to the
 actual tag. Inline style sheets take priority over embedded style sheets. Between embedded style sheets an external style sheets, 
 embedded style takes precedence.

27. How do active links differ from normal links?
Normal and active links have blue as their default color. Certain browsers are capable of detecting an active link when the mouse 
cursor hovers over that link. The other browsers detect the active link when the link has the focus. An active link is in the action 
of opening the resource that is being pointed to.

Normal link contains a pointer to another resource. Those links don't have a mouse cursor over it. A normal link becomes an active 
link when the user clicks on it.

28. What is the significance of and tag in HTML?
<head> contains the information about the document. It is always enclosed in the <html> tag. <head> contains the webpage metadata and 
    tags like <style>, <link>, <meta>, <script>, etc. that are not displayed on the web page. In an HTML document. there can be only 
    one <head> tag and it is one used before the <body> tag.

<body> defines the body of an HTML document and is always enclosed within the <html> tag. Any content that needs to be displayed on
     the web page, such as text, audio, images, video, contents, can be done using tags like <p>, <img>, <audio>, <heading>, <video>, 
        <div>, etc. These tags have to be enclosed within the <body> tag. There can be only one <body> element in an HTML document and
             it is used after the <head> tag.

29. How can a table be displayed on an HTML webpage?
Data can be displayed in a tabular format with the help of the <table> tag. It can also be used to manage the layout of the web page.
     For example, the header section, the navigation bar, the content of the body, and the footer section.

The following HTML tags are used for when building a table on an HTML webpage:

Tag	Description
<table>	This tag defines the table.
<tr>	The <tr> tag is used to define a row in the table.
<th>	It is used for defining the header cell in a table.
<td>	The <td> tag defines a cell in a table.
<caption>	It defines the table caption.
<colgroup>	It specifies a group of one or multiple columns for the purpose of formatting.
<col>	This tag is used with <colgroup> for specifying column properties for each column.
<tbody>	<tbody> groups the content of the body in a table.
<thead>	It groups the header content in a table.
<tfoot>	<tfoot> groups the footer content in a table.
30. How do you create links to different sections within the same HTML web page?
Links to different sections can be created within the same web page by using the <a> tag, along with the # symbol for referencing.

31. How can you create nested web pages in HTML?
When there are web pages within a webpage, these are called nested web pages. These nested web pages in HTML can be developed with the
 help of the built-in <iframe> tag. It defines an inline frame. For example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
